#### Wr3 Helo App Simulation


#### Database

- PostgresSQL
- Massive (backend => req, res)
    - massive handles connection to our Heroku database and server
- Express ( need express when creating a RESTful Api)
- Express-session (Handles creating user sessions/app-sessions in general)
- bcrypt ( Makes us able to {Hash} our password)
    -bcryptjs vs bcrypt:
        - bcrypt: only works with node, need further dependencies.
        - bcryptjs: Works on all major browsers, 


#### Front-end (client-side-end)

Dependencies:
    - express
    - axios (req, res)
    - React-redux
    - redux-promise-middleware
    - react-router-DOM

    File Structure: 
    - src/
     app.js

File Structure:

    Server:

#### Strategy 

Trello: Organize checklist items, 

Figma: 
    - Visual drawing outline of front-end design. 
    - Visual to include port and server mapping for axios and express calls



#### Ref: 
    - RESTful (Representational Stat Transfer)
    - API (Application-programminig Interface)
Redux: 
packages needed to Add Redux to React App (order doesn't matter at top but need both)
- Redux
- react-Redux
#### Redux Setup: 
    1. Keep things organized and create folder for Redux
        - Ex. ' redux' 
    2. Need Store.js: Is where you actually store the reducer and store. bring in one reducer or mult. reducers, (depending if walmart or mom & pop store)
    3. Takes in the request and sends them back out.
    4. if you have outside information brought in with PROPs
    5. tracking of the input and outputs of the communication of Frontend/Backend of App.

#### Component Refersher:
    - Components are plain VJS functions. 

#### Using { HashRouter }:
    -HashRouter needs to be placed 

(Phone number analogy):
- If you called me on your phone, I picked up, whether you recieved the
req - What comes in, on the back-end, hold info for what comes in, that holds the request
res - a tool for us to use to send information back as a response. 
end points are like us creating a number on the back-end.
ex. - like saying 'app.get' 
- use Axios to hit those endpoints to call/reach those numbers.
