- PostgresSQL
- Massive (backend => req, res)
- Express ( need express when creating a RESTful Api)
- Express-session (Handles creating user sessions/app-sessions in general)
- bcrypt ( Makes us able to {Hash} our password)
    -bcryptjs vs bcrypt:
        - bcrypt: only works with node, need further dependencies.
        - bcryptjs: Works on all major browsers,
