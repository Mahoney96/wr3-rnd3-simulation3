#### Wr3 Helo App Simulation


#### Database

- PostgresSQL
- Massive (backend => req, res)
    - massive handles connection to our Heroku database and server
- Express ( need express when creating a RESTful Api)
- Express-session (Handles creating user sessions/app-sessions in general)
- bcrypt ( Makes us able to {Hash} our password)
    -bcryptjs vs bcrypt:
        - bcrypt: only works with node, need further dependencies.
        - bcryptjs: Works on all major browsers, 


#### Front-end (client-side-end)

Dependencies:
    - express
    - axios (req, res)
    - React-redux
    - redux-promise-middleware
    - react-router-DOM

    File Structure: 
    - src/
     app.js


Looking at the Helo visuals what components will be needed to be built? (Provided but what is the funcationality involved?)

File Structure:

    Server:

#### Strategy 

Trello: Organize checklist items, 

Figma: 
    - Visual drawing outline of front-end design.

Ref: 

Redux: 
packages needed to Add Redux to React App (order doesn't matter at top but need both)
- Redux
- react-Redux


Setup: 
    1. Keep things organized and create folder for Redux
        - Ex. ' redux' 
    2. Need Store.js: Is where you actually store the reducer and store. bring in one reducer or mult. reducers, (depending if walmart or mom & pop store)
    3. Takes in the request and sends them back out.
    4. if you have outside information brought in with PROPs




    - RESTful (Representational Stat Transfer)
    - API (Application-programminig Interface)
    

Using { HashRouter }:
    -HashRouter needs to be placed
